This is a final Data Mining report at SGH. The report aimed to explore the dataset and construct multiple ML models to predict the occurrence of a stroke. For this purpose, three machine learning models were built: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines. After training the models on the training set, their predictive power was compared based on the confusion matrix, performance metrics, ROC curve, and area under the ROC curve.
