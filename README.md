This is a final Data Mining report at SGH. 
The report aimed to thoroughly explore the dataset and construct multiple ML models to predict the occurrence of a stroke. For this purpose, three machine learning models were built: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines. After training the models on the training set, their predictive power was compared based on the confusion matrix, performance metrics, ROC curve, and area under the ROC curve.
In the vast majority of evaluation methods, the AdaBoost model performed well, achieving the highest performance metrics and having the largest area under the ROC curve. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model also proved to be effective in predicting the occurrence of a stroke, while the Gradient Boosting model was the weakest in terms of predictive power.
It is worth noting that a modified dataset with undersampling was used in the study, consisting of 496 observations. Since undersampling was employed to address data imbalance by removing observations from the majority class, it could potentially result in reduced predictive power of the model on real-world data.
